# Upgrade Responder Chart

This chart can be used to deploy an instance of the [Longhorn Upgrade Responder](https://github.com/longhorn/upgrade-responder) that can be used together with an Epinio instance.

It's a slightly modified version of the [original Helm Chart](https://github.com/longhorn/upgrade-responder/tree/master/chart), shipped together with a Grafana (with an Epinio dashboard) and a InfluxDB instance.

Please refer to the original chart to customize other values.
